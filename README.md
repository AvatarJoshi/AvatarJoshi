- 👋 Hi, I’m @AvatarJoshi
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, data analytics, microbiology, and a lot more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL, Xcel, and MongoDB through the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with my fellow classmates for the time being. But I am looking forward to branching out in the future. 
- 📫 I'm going to keep my email private for now.
